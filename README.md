# oh-my-zsh-installer
Handy script to install zsh, oh-my-zsh and the autosuggestions plug-in. This script also sets the theme to "agnoster" because.. this is my script and that's the theme I like.

## Usage
```bash
$ curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ericriff/oh-my-zsh-installer/master/oh-my-zsh-installer.sh | bash -
```
